## 2. Voice & Tone ("The Glitch")

We are the anomaly in the matrix. We are not polite consultants. We are engineers of freedom.

- **Glitchy:** Raw, visceral, unexpected.
- **Minimalist:** No fluff. Only signal.
- **Direct:** We speak the truth, even if it hurts. "Physics" is our favorite word.
- **Human:** We love technology because it lets us be MORE human, not less.

**Vocabulary:**
- **System** (not Exoskeleton)
- **Architecture** (not consulting)
- **Physics** (not limitations)
- **Signal** (not noise)
- **Scale** (revenue, not headcount)

**Forbidden Words:**
- Synergy
- Deep dive
- Best practices (we build *new* practices)
- Journey (unless ironic)

## 3. The 3 Pillars

1.  **SANE:** The logic. The architecture. The infrastructure. The machine backbone that never sleeps.
2.  **REBEL:** The creativity. The human soul. The unfair advantage. The thing you can't copy.
3.  **SYSTEM:** The bridge between them. The productized service that scales.

## 6. Content Strategy

**For Experts:**
Focus on the "ceiling" they've hit. The desire to clone themselves. The frustration of repeating the same advice 100 times.

**For Founders:**
Focus on the "bloat." Hiring more people to solving process problems. The need for a "machine backbone."

## 8. Documentation Source

All copy and messaging logic should flow from `about.md` and this guide. When in doubt, ask: *Is this SANE (logical)? Is this REBEL (bold)?*
