# SANE/REBELS Brand & Product Guide

## The Core Truth

**What SANE/REBELS is about:**
Machines got powerful. Time to be more human.

**The Philosophy:**
- We're not anti-tech. We're pro-human *using* tech.
- AI handles the mundane so humans can handle the meaningful.
- The rebellion isn't against work. It's against becoming machine-like when machines can do the machine stuff.
- Let AI do the grunt work → humans get to be playful, authentic, grounded, rebellious.

## The Founder: Simon Roser

### The Journey (Story Arc)
1. **Google** (4 years) → 500+ companies, saw the patterns, learned go-to-market
2. **Built own company** → Left to actually DO it, ran it for 5 years, learned what ships vs. what sounds smart in a deck
3. **Fractional CMO** → Went deeper, traded time for money, *experienced* the trap
4. **Automation obsession** → Went deep on n8n, AI, systems - not to become a machine, to stop acting like one
5. **Now: SANE/REBELS** → Helping others escape the same trap

### The Tension That IS Simon
- Obsessed with automation, coding, AI-guided co-creation in the digital
- BUT loves offline, loves storytelling, loves being in flow, loves authenticity, loves growth
- Automated the hell out of things so he could be MORE present, MORE in flow, MORE authentic
