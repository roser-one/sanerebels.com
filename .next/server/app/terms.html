This includes:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside text-foreground/80 space-y-1 mb-4"><li><strong>Consulting:</strong> Strategic consulting (e.g., &quot;The Naked Strategy Session&quot;, &quot;The Sanity Audit&quot;).</li><li><strong>Technology &amp; Automation:</strong> Development of custom software, automation workflows (e.g., n8n blueprints), and provision of proprietary tools.</li><li><strong>Agency Services:</strong> Management of advertising campaigns (Google Ads, Bing Ads, Meta) and creative direction.</li></ul><p class="text-foreground/80">The specific scope is defined in the individual contract, Statement of Work (SOW), or accepted offer.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">2.2 Legal Classification</h3><p class="text-foreground/80 mb-2">Unless expressly stated otherwise in the SOW, services are classified under German law as follows:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside text-foreground/80 space-y-1"><li><strong>Consulting &amp; Agency Services (Service Contract):</strong> Services such as strategy sessions, audits, and ongoing advertising account management are provided as service contracts. We owe careful performance according to best practices, not a specific economic result (e.g., specific ROAS or revenue targets).</li><li><strong>Software Development (Work Contract):</strong> The custom development of specific, finished software applications or codebases is provided as a work contract. Success is defined as delivery of functional software according to technical specifications.</li></ul><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">2.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation</h3><p class="text-foreground/80 mb-2">The Client acknowledges that the Contractor uses advanced AI tools (e.g., LLMs, Generative AI) and automation platforms to deliver services efficiently.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside text-foreground/80 space-y-1"><li><strong>No Guarantee of Uniqueness for AI Content:</strong> The Client understands that purely AI-generated elements (e.g., raw texts or images generated by Midjourney/Gemini) may not be copyright protected under applicable law and are provided &quot;as is&quot;.</li><li><strong>Human Review:</strong> Although we act as &quot;adult supervision&quot; for AI outputs, the Client is responsible for final legal compliance review of all published content.</li></ul></section><section><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">§ 3 Contract Formation and Duration</h2><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">3.1 Contract Formation</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">Contracts are formed through written agreement (email is sufficient) or by acceptance of a written offer/SOW by the Client.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">3.2 Duration and Termination</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside text-foreground/80 space-y-1"><li><strong>One-time Projects:</strong> End upon completion of the agreed service.</li><li><strong>Retainer/Ongoing Engagements:</strong> Unless otherwise agreed, ongoing contracts run for an indefinite period and may be terminated by either party with 30 days&#x27; notice to the end of the month.</li><li><strong>Fixed-term Contracts:</strong> Contracts with a fixed term (e.g., 3-month sprints) cannot be terminated early except for important reasons.</li></ul></section><section><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">§ 4 Remuneration and Payment</h2><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">4.1 Remuneration</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">All remuneration is net prices plus the statutory value-added tax (VAT) applicable at the time of invoicing.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">4.2 Payment Terms</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">Invoices are due for payment within 14 days of the invoice date without deduction.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">4.3 Payment Default</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">In case of default, the Contractor reserves the right to charge statutory default interest and to suspend all services (including pausing advertising campaigns or restricting access to software dashboards) until payment is received in full.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">4.4 Reactivation Fee</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">After a service suspension pursuant to § 4.3, a one-time reactivation fee will be charged for resuming services.

In case of conflict, the provisions of the Side Letter take precedence over these GTC.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">§ 5 Change Requests and Scope Management</h2><h3 class="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4 mb-2">5.1 Change Requests</h3><p class="text-foreground/80">If the Client wishes to change the agreed scope of services, these must be submitted in writing as a change request.
