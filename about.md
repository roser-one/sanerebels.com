# SANE/REBELS — Brand Bible

## 1. THE CORE TRUTH

**Done trading time? Let's build something.**

You have expert knowledge. You have a service. But it relies on you being in the room.
**You can't scale a human.**

We don't change what you do. We change how it travels. We turn service into product. It travels to a thousand places at once. You stay in one.

### The Logic
We do not sell "consulting." We build digital architecture.

- **SANE:** The logic. The Python scripts. The Supabase backend. The machine backbone that never sleeps.
- **REBEL:** The creativity. The human soul. The unfair advantage. The thing you cannot copy.
- **SYSTEM:** The bridge. The productized service that scales.

## 2. THE TARGETS

We serve experts who have won the "Skill" game but are losing the "Time" game.

### 1. "The Capped Healer"
- **Who:** High-end somatic coaches, trauma therapists.
- **Problem:** Booked solid. Turning away people who need help because they can't afford the rate.
- **Goal:** Democratization. Offering the "Junior Version" of their guidance to thousands without burning out.
- **Solution:** A digital vessel for their wisdom that doesn't need a Zoom call.

### 2. "The Ethical Rainmaker"
- **Who:** Sales trainers for meaningful sectors (Renewables, Social Good).
- **Problem:** Stuck doing onsite workshops. Teaching the same thing to different faces.
- **Goal:** Standards. Training entire teams at scale with a "Training OS."
- **Solution:** A platform that feels as high-status and ethical as their in-person training.

### 3. "The System Thinker"
- **Who:** Growth minds, Lean Ops experts.
- **Problem:** Buried in "Excel Hell." Methodology is manual and breaks when they look away.
- **Goal:** Asset Creation. Turning a consulting process into a software asset.
- **Solution:** Code that handles the routine logic automatically.

### The DNA
- **Fear:** Dilution. Looking cheap or "buggy."
- **Enemy:** "Passive Income" bros, "Funnels," and marketing slang.
- **Desire:** Impact. Making the world better, not just the bank account fatter.

## 3. THE EXECUTION

We do not just automate. We engineer the physics of your business.

### Phase 1: The Trust Anchor
**"The Naked Strategy Session"**
- **Action:** We strip the business to the studs.
- **Goal:** Separate Signal (Your unique value) from Noise (Ops/Admin).
- **Deliverable:** A blueprint. What stays Human (REBEL) vs. What becomes Machine (SANE).

### Phase 2: The Architecture
**Custom Digital Infrastructure (MVP)**
- **Action:** We build the machine.
- **The Stack:**
    - **Brain:** Python + LLMs (AI) for logic.
    - **Memory:** Supabase (Postgres) for data.
    - **Nervous System:** n8n for workflow.
    - **Face:** React/Next.js for the experience.
- **Outcome:** A living system. Not a course. A product.

### Phase 3: The Partnership
**"Shared Risk Model"**
- **Action:** We run the machine. You bring the wisdom.
- **Deal:** Retainer + Profit Share. We co-invest in the architecture.

## 4. BRAND VOICE

**Tone:** Visceral. High-Status. Radically Honest.
We are engineers of freedom, not polite consultants.

### Vocabulary Rules
- **Use:** System, Architecture, Physics, Signal, Machine.
- **FORBIDDEN:** Exoskeleton, Synergy, Deep dive, Journey, "Unlock potential," Hustle.

### Key Messages
- "You can't scale a human."
- "Machines do machine work. Humans stay human."
- "Authenticity without infrastructure is just noise."
- "Sane enough to build it. Rebel enough to ship it."

## 5. VISUAL SYSTEM

**Aesthetic:** High-end terminal meets fashion magazine. Efficient. Beautiful. Dark Mode First.

### Design Tokens
- **Background:** Deep Purple `oklch(0.12 0.01 280)`
- **Text:** White `oklch(0.98 0 0)`
- **Accent:** Electric Purple `oklch(0.78 0.28 295)`
- **Font:** `Geist Sans` (Structure) + `Geist Mono` (Code).
- **Interaction:** Magnetic buttons. Smooth snap-scrolling.

## 6. OPERATIONAL LOGIC & IP RIGHTS

- **Legal Entity:** KNUS GmbH (Konstanz/Berlin).
- **Managing Director:** Simon Roser.

### Intellectual Property (The Rules)
- **Client Owns:** The Brand, The Content, The Data, The "Frontend" Experience.
- **KNUS GmbH Owns:** The "Background IP" (The Engine, n8n Blueprints, Code Libraries).
- **The License:** Client gets a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use the Engine. They own the car; we own the patent on the motor.

## 7. FOUNDER PROFILE

**Simon Roser. The Architect.**

- **History:** Google (Scale) -> Founder (Shipping) -> Fractional CMO (Strategy).
- **The Shift:** Realized consulting is limited by physics. Turned to code.
- **Superpower:** Structural Vision. Seeing the architectural patterns where others only see chaos. Building the infrastructure to make abstract ideas real.

*"We don't just advise. We build. We work on challenges worth solving."*

## Brand Copy Source (The Live Pages)

### Manifest (Why)
We built incredible technology to save time. Then we spent that time acting like the technology.
We optimized for speed but lost the direction. Most founders try to scale a vision on top of manual labor.
But impact is limited by physics. You can only be in one room at a time.
Hiring more people to solve process problems is not scaling. That is bloating.

**Authenticity without infrastructure is just noise.**

To scale a human story, you need a machine backbone. We do not sell hustle. We sell architecture.
We build the Exoskeleton that carries the weight of the business. We replace the chaos of operations with the precision of code.

The enemy is not AI. The enemy is inefficiency. The enemy is a founder buried in spreadsheets instead of strategy.

Machines do machine work. We automate the admin. We engineer the routine.
Your authentic voice is the only competitive advantage left. It is the only thing that cannot be copied.
But it cannot be heard if you are drowning.

A business that runs. A founder that sleeps.
Scale the revenue. Keep the soul.

*Sane enough to build it. Rebel enough to ship it.*

### How It Works (What)
We don't change what you do. We change how it travels.
You have a methodology that works. We take that expert knowledge and build digital infrastructure around it. Service turns into product. It travels to a thousand places at once. You stay in one.

**Not replacing the human. Letting human do human work. System handles the rest.**

**01. System**
Authenticity, at scale, needs infrastructure. We build the machine backbone. AI and automation handle administration. Data. Routine logic. Service delivery becomes precise. Every time. It carries your fingerprint. Even when you aren't touching the keyboard.
> **Distill:** We look at your craft. Identify the magic. Frameworks. Decisions. Intuition. Separate strategic value from operational noise.

**02. Shared Risk**
We believe in what we build. No interest in "hit-and-run" consulting or hourly billing. If potential exists, we co-invest. Lower upfront risk. Shared upside. Partners. Not vendors. You win. We win.
> **Build:** Concepts turn into code. Deployment of custom software. GrowthOS. Automation workflows. Manual service becomes scalable asset.

**03. Momentum**
No 18-month roadmaps. Work happens in 30-90 day sprints. Define core value. Build it. Put it in hands of real users. Learn by shipping. Not by planning.
> **Scale:** Launch. Watch data. Refine. Partnership begins here. We manage tech. You manage vision.

### Experience (Who)
**"We don't just advise. We are at our best when we co-create. Build. Work on challenges worth solving."**

**Founder & Systems Architect: Simon Roser**
Four years at Google. 500+ companies. Saw the patterns. Left to build. Ran my own company for 5 years. Learned shipping matters more than slides (and so much more).

Then Fractional CMO. Loved the work. Solving problems is addictive. But I ran into physics. I could only be in one room at a time. I was selling hours. But we wanted to share know-how with more than just one board room.

We thrive in high speed. Abstractions. Principles. Systems. We build infrastructure because we need it. To turn complex ideas into reality. To handle speed without losing direction. Now we build those systems for others. Making authenticity scalable.

- **Google:** 4 years. 500+ high-growth companies. Saw the blueprint.
- **Founder:** 5 years. Bootstrapped. Learned reality of shipping.
- **Fractional CMO:** 2 years. Solved growth problems. Hit ceiling of time-for-money.
- **Now (SANE/REBELS):** Multiplying impact through systems.
