# SANE/REBELS — Brand & Content Source

## The Core Truth

**Done trading time? Let's build something.**

We turn your expert knowledge into a scalable, digital architecture. You have a service. It relies on you being in the room. That is a trap. We don't change what you do. We change how it travels.

## Value Proposition

### The Offer
**Vehicle for Expertise.**
Service turns into product. It travels to a thousand places at once. You stay in one.

### How It Works
1. **System** — Authenticity, at scale, needs infrastructure. We build the machine backbone. AI and automation handle administration so the product carries your fingerprint.
    - **Distill** — Identify the magic. Separate strategic value from operational noise.
2. **Shared Risk** — No "hit-and-run" consulting. If potential exists, we co-invest. Lower upfront risk. Shared upside. Partners. Not vendors.
    - **Build** — Concepts turn into code. GrowthOS. Automation workflows.
3. **Momentum** — No 18-month roadmaps. 30-90 day sprints. Learn by shipping. Not by planning.
    - **Scale** — Launch. Watch data. Refine.

## The Target: "The Capped Expert"

**Who they are:**
Veterans of their craft. Consultants, Agencies, Specialized Service Providers. They don't need leads; they need cloning. They have already won the "skill" game but are losing the "time" game.

**The Psychographics:**
- **High Integrity:** They refuse to sell "passive income" dreams. They care deeply about the quality of the delivery.
- **The "Physics" Wall:** They hit a revenue ceiling that can only be broken by working more hours or hiring an army. They want neither.
- **The Tension:** They love the work but hate the tether. They want the impact of software with the soul of a service.

**The Current State:**
- Successful but exhausted.
- Revenue is linear (Time = Money).
- Attempted to "productize" before (courses, templates) but it felt hollow or generic.

**What they want:**
- **Legacy/Reach:** To travel to a thousand rooms at once without being in them.
- **Infrastructure:** A machine that executes their methodology with their precision.
- **Partnership:** Not a vendor who "does the tech," but a partner who understands the *business logic* of their expertise.

## About The Founder: Simon Roser

**Founder & Systems Architect**

Four years at Google. 500+ companies. Saw the patterns. Left to build. Ran my own company for 5 years. Learned shipping matters more than slides.

Then Fractional CMO. Loved the work. Solving problems is addictive. But hit a hard limit: Physics. Could only be in one room at a time. Selling hours.

We didn't want to stop helping. We wanted to multiply the impact. So we built the System. Systems to clone the strategy. Automation to handle the execution.

We thrive in high speed. Abstractions. Principles. Systems. We build infrastructure because we need it. To turn complex ideas into reality. Now we build those systems for others. Making authenticity scalable.

**"We don't just advise. We are at our best when we co-create. Build. Work on challenges worth solving."**

### Experience
- **Google** | 4 years, 500+ high-growth companies accelerated
- **Founder** | 5 years, Bootstrapped. Learned reality of shipping.
- **Fractional CMO** | 2 years, Solved growth problems. Hit ceiling of time-for-money.
- **Now: SANE/REBELS** | Multiplying impact through systems.

## Manifest (Why)

You have a methodology that works. You help businesses and individuals through meaningful offers. Solve problems. Create impact. But impact is limited by physics. You can only be in one room at a time.

We don't change what you do. We change how it travels. We take expert knowledge. Build digital infrastructure around it. Service turns into product. It travels to a thousand places at once. You stay in one.

Not replacing the human. Letting human do human work. System handles the rest.
