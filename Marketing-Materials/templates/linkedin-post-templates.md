## Template 1: The Hot Take

```
[Contrarian statement about the industry]

Everyone says [common belief].

But here's what I've seen after [experience]:

[Your actual observation]

The truth? [Your insight]

---

[Call to action or question]
```

**Example:**
```
Everyone says AI will replace workers.

But here's what I've seen after building with 500+ companies:

AI replaces tasks, not people.

The truth? The best AI implementations make humans MORE human, not less.

---

Which tasks are you ready to hand off?
```

## Template 2: The Story Arc

```
[Year/Time], I was [situation].

[What I did]
[What I expected]
[What actually happened]

The lesson? [Insight]

Now I [what you do differently].

---

If you're [experiencing similar], [offer/CTA].
```

**Example:**
```
2019, I was a fractional CMO making great money.

I took on more clients.
I expected more freedom.
I got more burnout.

The lesson? Selling hours has a ceiling. And that ceiling is you.

Now I help experts productize their service so they can scale beyond themselves.

---

If you're stuck trading time for money, let's talk.
```

## Template 3: The Framework

```
The [X] Framework for [Outcome]:

1. [Step 1] → [Result]
2. [Step 2] → [Result]
3. [Step 3] → [Result]

Most people skip [step] and wonder why [problem].

---

Which step are you stuck on?
```

**Example:**
```
The GOLD Framework for productizing your service:

1. Find → What do you do better than anyone?
2. Build → AI handles grunt work, you keep the soul
3. Ship → Real users in 30-90 days

Most people skip "Find" and wonder why their product doesn't resonate.

---

Which step are you stuck on?
```

---

## Template 4: The Myth Buster

```
Myth: [Common misconception]

Reality: [What's actually true]

The difference matters because [why it matters].

Here's what [smart people/companies] do instead:

• [Action 1]
• [Action 2]
• [Action 3]

---

[Question or CTA]
```

---

## Template 5: The Reflection

```
[Time period] ago, I [did something].

If I could tell myself one thing, it would be:

[Advice]

Not because [obvious reason].

But because [deeper insight].

---

What would you tell your past self?
```
