## Slide Structure

### 1. Title Slide
- **SANE/REBELS** logo (centered)
- "We productize your service. You stay human."
- Your name / Date / Occasion

### 2. The Problem
- "Machines got powerful. Time to be more human."
- Subject matter experts stuck in the time-for-money trap
- Success leads to burnout, not freedom
- Knowledge is locked in their heads

### 3. The Irony
- "We built tools to save time."
- "Then spent that time acting like the tools."
- Visual: Human becoming machine vs machine doing machine work

### 4. The Flip
- AI handles the mundane
- Humans handle the meaningful
- "The rebellion? Going home on time."
- "The sanity? Being present when you get there."

### 5. The Solution
- "Sane enough to build it. Rebel enough to ship it."
- Three pillars:
  1. **Co-invest** - Skin in the game, aligned incentives
  2. **AI-powered, human-fingerprinted** - Your voice, your soul
  3. **30-90 days** - From concept to real users, fast

### 6. The Process
1. **Find the Gold** - What's the scalable piece hiding in your expertise?
2. **Build It** - AI does grunt work, you keep the soul
3. **Win Together** - Partnership, not handoff

### 7. The Founder
- Simon Roser
- Ex-Google (4 years, 500+ companies)
- Built own company (5 years)
- Fractional CMO (experienced the trap)
- Now: Helping others escape

### 8. Social Proof (if applicable)
- Case studies
- Testimonials
- Results

### 9. The Ask / CTA
- "Let's."
- "Build something that scales. Get back to being human."

## Talking Points

### Opening Hook
"Everyone's talking about AI replacing jobs. I think they're missing the point. AI isn't here to replace us. It's here to let us stop acting like machines."

### The Core Message
"We help experts productize their service. AI handles the grunt work. You keep the soul. Together, we build something that scales without you losing yourself."

### The Differentiator
"Most consultants advise. We co-invest. Your win is my win. Your risk is my risk. That's the difference."

### The Close
"The rebellion isn't against work. It's against becoming machine-like when machines can do the machine stuff. Ready to rebel?"
