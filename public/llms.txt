# SANE/REBELS (KNUS GmbH)

> "Done trading time? Let's build something."

## Identity
*   **Who**: SANE/REBELS (Operating brand of KNUS GmbH)
*   **Archetype**: The Architect x The Rebel
*   **Mission**: To build the commercial "Exoskeleton" for expert businesses. We ensure human authenticity scales through infrastructure.

## The Core Thesis
**Authenticity Engineered.**
In the age of AI, human authenticity is the only moat. But authenticity without infrastructure is just noise.
*   **The Problem**: Visionary companies build a "Ferrari Engine" (Product) but drive it with "Bicycle Brakes" (Manual Ops).
*   **The Solution**: We build the **Exoskeleton** (RevOps, Automation, AI) that scales the story without burning out the founder.
*   **The Enemy**: "AI Slop", Vanity Metrics, and Corporate Yes-Men.

## Differentiation
We are **not** an agency. We are a **Venture Lab** that co-invests in the partners we build with.
We fight "AI Slop" by anchoring all tech in the founder's specific domain expertise.

## Capabilities
*   **Strategy**: RevOps, Commercialization, Profit Share Models.
*   **Tech Stack**: Python, Supabase, n8n, React/Next.js, GenAI.

## Founder
**Simon Roser** (Managing Director)
*   Ex-Google, Former Founder, Fractional CMO.
*   "I don't execute for you; I build the machine with you."
