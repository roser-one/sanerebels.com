# SANE/REBELS (KNUS GmbH) — CONTEXT

> **DIRECTIVE**: This is not a marketing agency. This is a Venture Lab for scaling expert knowledge.

## 1. THE MANIFEST (Core Philosophy)
**The Reality:** You are good at what you do. You spent years getting here. But you can only help so many people in your time.
**The Problem:** Your wisdom sits in a folder somewhere, locked behind a calendar and a meeting link.
**The Goal:** It is not about "passive income." It is about **impact**.
**The Method:** We are sane enough to use technology as a bridge, not a wall. We make authenticity scalable.

## 2. WHAT WE DO
We do not sell time. We build the infrastructure that distributes your expertise.
* **Extraction:** We take the knowledge out of your head/folders.
* **Construction:** We build the software/automation to deliver it.
* **Distribution:** We launch it as an asset, not a service.

## 3. TECH STACK (Capabilities)
We build proprietary assets.
* **Logic:** Python, LLMs (Gemini/Perplexity/OpenRouter).
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
* **Automation:** n8n (Server-side workflows).
* **Web:** React / Next.js.
